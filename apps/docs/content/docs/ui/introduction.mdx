## What is This Project?

This is a **Next.js boilerplate** that provides an opinionated, production-ready foundation for building modern web applications. It's designed to give you everything you need to start building immediately, with carefully chosen tools and patterns that work together seamlessly.

## Why This Boilerplate?

Instead of starting from scratch and spending time configuring tools, this boilerplate gives you:

- **Opinionated project structure** that scales with your team
- **Monorepo setup** for managing multiple apps and packages
- **Best-in-class tools** that are proven in production
- **Accessibility-first approach** with React Aria components
- **Default good-looking components** that you can customize or replace
- **Modern development patterns** that make your code maintainable

## Key Features

### Project Architecture
- **Monorepo structure** using pnpm workspaces and Turborepo
- **Opinionated folder organization** that scales from small to large projects
- **TypeScript-first** with strict configuration and shared types
- **ESLint and Prettier** setup for consistent code quality

### Accessibility-First Components
- **React Aria-based components** instead of Radix UI for better accessibility
- **Enhanced calendar and date picker** with superior UX
- **Better pagination** with comprehensive features
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent, maintainable styling
- **Dark mode support** with next-themes

### State Management & Data Fetching
- **TanStack Query** for powerful async state management
- **Optimistic updates** and background refetching
- **Built-in caching** and synchronization
- **Error boundaries** and retry mechanisms

### Form Management
- **React Hook Form** for performant form handling
- **Zod validation** with TypeScript integration
- **Field arrays** and conditional field logic
- **Form submission** with proper error handling

### Comprehensive Examples
- **Form management patterns** with validation strategies
- **Data fetching strategies** and error handling
- **Loading states** and user feedback
- **Real-world use cases** that you can adapt to your needs

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Components**: React Aria-based UI components
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Data**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Build**: Turborepo for monorepo management
- **Package Manager**: pnpm for fast, efficient dependency management
