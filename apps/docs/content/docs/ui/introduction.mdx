## Why I Built This Library

While shadcn/ui provides excellent components, I recognized that some components relying on Radix UI had accessibility limitations. I decided to create a comprehensive solution that addresses these concerns by leveraging **React Aria** - a library specifically designed for building accessible UI components.

## Key Features

### üéØ Accessibility First
- Built on **React Aria** - the gold standard for accessible React components
- Full ARIA compliance and keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimized with proper semantic markup
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance out of the box

### üöÄ Modern React Patterns
- Built for React 19+ with the latest hooks and patterns
- TypeScript-first with comprehensive type definitions
- Optimized for Next.js 15+ and modern bundlers
- Zero runtime overhead with tree-shaking support

### üé® Flexible Styling
- **Tailwind CSS** integration with custom design tokens
- CSS-in-JS with **class-variance-authority** for variant management
- Responsive design patterns built-in
- Dark mode support with **next-themes**

### üîß Developer Experience
- Consistent API across all components
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Built-in form handling with **React Hook Form** and **Zod**
- Extensive customization options

## Browser Support

- **Modern browsers** (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- **React 18+** with concurrent features
- **Node.js 18+** for build tools
