description: Get started with the UI package by cloning the repository and installing dependencies
---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hoanggd/base-stack
cd base-stack
```

## Install Dependencies

Install all workspace dependencies using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install dependencies for all packages in the monorepo.

## Development

To start the development servers for both projects:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start two development servers:
- **docs**: Documentation site at `http://localhost:9009`
- **web**: Web application at `http://localhost:3000`

The docs app showcases the UI components and documentation, while the web app is the main application.

## Building

To build the project for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```
